## History / Overview
The <b>Chaocipher</b> is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher invented by John Francis Byrne in 1918. He stated that it was a simple, yet unbreakable cipher as the machine he used to encode his messages could fit into a cigar box. He even offered cash rewards for anyone who could crack it! 

The Chaocipher won over numerous cryptoanalysts for almost a whole century. It wasn't until May 2010 when Bryne's daughter-in-law donated Chaocipher related things to the National Cryptologic Museum when the algorithm was finally revealed to the world.
