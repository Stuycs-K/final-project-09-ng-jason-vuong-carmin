## History / Overview
The <b>Chaocipher</b> is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher invented by John Francis Byrne in 1918. He stated that it was a simple, yet unbreakable cipher as the machine he used to encode his messages could fit into a cigar box. He even offered cash rewards for anyone who could crack it! 

The Chaocipher won over numerous cryptoanalysts for almost a whole century. It wasn't until May 2010 when Bryne's daughter-in-law donated Chaocipher related things to the National Cryptologic Museum when the algorithm was finally revealed to the world. 


## How it works
The Chaocipher makes use of 2 disks (left and right), each one having 26 removable "tabs". There are 26 tabs for each of the 26 letters in the alphabet. These 2 disks are connected to one another so when one disk turns, the other disk turns along with it in the opposite direction. (ex. if left turns CW then right turns CCW). On each wheel, the top letter is known as the <b>zenith</b> and the bottom letter is known as the <b>nadir</b>.

When adding the alphabet keys to each wheel, the first letter always starts at the zenith and they go in opposite directions for each wheel.
