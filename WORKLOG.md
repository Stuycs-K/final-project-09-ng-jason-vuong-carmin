# Work Log

## Jason Ng

### 5/22/2024 

Worked on getting everything set up 
- networking files
- encrypt & decrypt
- did some research on RSA/blowfish/other algorithms
- set up the THM

### 5/23/2024

Pivoted ideas so worked on researching primarily 
- coded encrypt and decrypt 
- encrypt and decrypt aren't entirely accurate, however; need to go back and fix that 

### 5/28/2024
Mostly worked on coding the algorithm
- finished encryption and decryption 
- wrote helper methods 
- refactored some code 

### 5/29/2024
Added a way to take in inputs for the cipher 
- made checks to ensure that the keys were of the same length
- made sure to reject the plain key if they did not contain the proper set of characters 

## 5/30/2024
Trying to reformat the cipher to accept files as inputs 
- want to make this cipher available for byte data, not just chars 
- attempted to make a bytearray, but this did not work

## Carmin Vuong

### 5/23/2024
Found new idea of Chaociphers <br>
Worked on visualization part of this project using Processing
- made 2 wheels (Wheel class)
- added spokes for visual appeal
- added letters

### 5/28/2024
work on rotation of the cipher wheel
- allowed CCW rotation of left wheel + CW rotation of the right wheel
